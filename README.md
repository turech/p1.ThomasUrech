Project 1

What the files do:
Old microwave interface: My_microwave_buttons.jpg
Old microwave whole: My_microwave_whole.jpg
- Note, these two files are too large to completely fit in the Github preview
Old microwave operation: My-microwave-operation.gif
-	Note, GIF is significantly compressed to fit inside 25Mb.
Microwave-Demo-nocom.gif: Project microwave demonstration with no commentary

p1.ThomasUrech.pde: The runner file for the microwave
clock_class.pde: class which runs the clock on the microwave.
timer_class.pde: class which runs the cook and non-cook timer on the microwave.
setter_class.pde: class which sets the timer/clock on the microwave.
Arial_MT-24.vlw: font data file for controlp5.
- Note, all 5 of these are required to run p1.ThomasUrech.pde. The font file goes in the "data" folder
- Note, must also install minim (sound) and controlp5 (buttons) to run p1.ThomasUrech.pde

braille_class.pde: unused. Meant to put braille letters over the buttons to make the design more accessible, but unfortunately the controlp5 buttons are in the top layer so I could not place anything over them. In real life, one could just add the letters to each button in manufacturing.
